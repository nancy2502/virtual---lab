#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator will ask to enter the value of impedance and current flowing in the circuit and will give the value of power | This will test give the result of the experiment
